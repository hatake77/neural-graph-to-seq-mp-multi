most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to uni- you &apos;re definitely not alone there. but i would really recommend that you get an appointment with your uni counselling services. it does n&apos;t really matter whether anyone has told you that you are depressed or not , you are obviously having some problems at the minute and could use some support- labels are n&apos;t as important as your experiences. meditation and exercise are really helpful , so definitely try to do those. but yeah , you will have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere- but do n&apos;t beat yourself up about feeling unmotivated to do anything at the minute , lots of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better. being unkind to yourself will only make you feel worse- be kind to yourself and get some help .
